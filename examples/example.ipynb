    "## 📌 Introduction\n",
    "- Objective: Demonstrate how to use NuggetizerRAG, a personal library for nugget-based evaluation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Context: Inspired by the AutoNuggetizer framework from the TREC 2024 RAG Track.\n",
    "- Use case: Provide interpretable and automatic evaluation metrics for open-domain QA and generation tasks using PyTerrier pipelines."

    "## 🎯 Motivation and Background\n",
    "- The Problem: Traditional RAG evaluations rely on lexical overlap or ROUGE scores, which miss semantic correctness.\n",
    "- The Solution: Nugget evaluation, originally proposed in TREC QA 2003, revived by AutoNuggetizer, uses semantically atomic facts (“nuggets”) to evaluate answers.\n",
    "- Inspiration: This library reimplements a simplified, local version of AutoNuggetizer with modular hooks into PyTerrier and HuggingFace models."
