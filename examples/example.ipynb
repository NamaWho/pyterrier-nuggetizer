    "## 📌 Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\n",
    "using a semantic nugget-based evaluation framework inspired by the \"AutoNuggetizer\" used in TREC 2024.\n",
    "The goal is to assess the factual informativeness of generated answers through fine-grained nugget detection\n",
    "and scoring. This setup is general and compatible with Google Colab (T4 GPU)."

    "## 🎯 Motivation and Background\n",
    "- The Problem: Traditional RAG evaluations rely on lexical overlap or ROUGE scores, which miss semantic correctness.\n",
    "- The Solution: Nugget evaluation, originally proposed in TREC QA 2003, revived by AutoNuggetizer, uses semantically atomic facts (“nuggets”) to evaluate answers.\n",
    "- Inspiration: This library reimplements a simplified, local version of AutoNuggetizer with modular hooks into PyTerrier and HuggingFace models."
