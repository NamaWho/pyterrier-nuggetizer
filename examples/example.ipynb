    "## 📌 Introduction\n",
    "- Objective: Demonstrate how to use NuggetizerRAG, a personal library for nugget-based evaluation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "- Context: Inspired by the AutoNuggetizer framework from the TREC 2024 RAG Track.\n",
    "- Use case: Provide interpretable and automatic evaluation metrics for open-domain QA and generation tasks using PyTerrier pipelines."

    "## 🎯 Motivation and Background\n",
    "- The Problem: Traditional RAG evaluations rely on lexical overlap or ROUGE scores, which miss semantic correctness.\n",
    "- The Solution: Nugget evaluation, originally proposed in TREC QA 2003, revived by AutoNuggetizer, uses semantically atomic facts (“nuggets”) to evaluate answers.\n",
    "- Inspiration: This library reimplements a simplified, local version of AutoNuggetizer with modular hooks into PyTerrier and HuggingFace models."

A landlord may be liable to the tenant--or others-for injuries caused by dangerous or defective conditions on the rental property. In order to hold the landlord responsible, the tenant must prove that the landlord was negligent and that the landlord\\'s negligence caused an injury. To do this, the injured person must show that: the landlord had control over the problem that caused the injury,\\nthe accident was foreseeable,\\nfixing the problem (or at least giving adequate warnings) would not have been unreasonably expensive or difficult,\\na serious injury was the probable consequence of not fixing the problem,\\nthe landlord failed to take reasonable steps to avert the accident,\\nthe landlord\\'s failure-his negligence caused the tenant\\'s accident, and\\nthe tenant was genuinely hurt. For example, if a tenant falls and breaks his ankle on a broken front door step, the landlord will be liable if the tenant can show that: it was the landlord\\'s responsibility to maintain the steps (this would usually be the case, because the steps are part of the common area, which is the landlord\\'s responsibility)\\nan accident of this type was foreseeable (falling on a broken step is highly likely)\\na repair would have been easy or inexpensive (fixing a broken step is a minor job)\\nthe probable result of a broken step is a serious injury (a fall certainly qualifies)\\nthe landlord failed to take reasonable measures to maintain the steps (this will be easy to prove if the step was broken for weeks, or even days, but less so if the step broke five minutes earlier and showed no previous signs of weakening)\\nthe broken step caused the injury (this is easy to prove if the tenant has a witness to the fall, but might be hard if there are no witnesses and the landlord claims that the tenant really got hurt somewhere else and is attempting to pin the blame on the landlord), and\\nthe tenant is really hurt (in the case of a broken bone, this is easy to establish).

If a landlord is found financially liable, the building owner\\'s liability insurance may cover the loss. Knowing About and Having Power to Remove the Dog\\nIn many states, someone trying to hold a landlord liable for injuries caused by a tenant\\'s dog must prove both that the landlord knew that the dog was dangerous and that the landlord had the power, legally, to make the tenant get rid of the dog or move out. As one court put it, a property owner cannot \"sit idly by in the face of the known danger to others.\" ( Linebaugh v.

But not all states use this rule. Under some laws, landlords are not liable even when they know a tenant\\'s dog is likely to hurt someone. A Montana rancher, for example, knew that a dog belonging to his foreman (who lived on the rancher\\'s property) had bitten someone. But when the dog later bit a utility company meter-reader, the rancher wasn\\'t held liable. If, however, the rancher had exercised some control over the animal, he would have been liable.

In a North Carolina case, a tenant\\'s two rottweilers attacked a visitor. The lease gave the landlord the right to demand that the tenant remove his dogs within 48 hours if the landlord decided that they were a nuisance or simply undesirable. The court concluded that this provision gave the landlord control over the tenant\\'s dogs, and he could have eliminated the danger they posed. ( Holcomb v. Colonial Associates, LLC, 597 S.E.2d 710 (N.C. 2004). A landlord who acquires a potentially dangerous or troublesome dog along with the property can still take measures to avoid injuries and liability. Eviction may be possible if the dog is a nuisance. Short of eviction, a landlord could fence in a yard, ask the tenant to keep the dog inside, or post warning signs. Injuries Off the Landlord\\'s Property\\nA landlord may be liable for injuries caused by a tenant\\'s dog even off the rented property. The Supreme Court of Oregon ruled that a landlord can be liable if the landlord knew that the dog posed an unreasonable risk of harm to persons off the rental property.\\n[5] most courts hold landlords liable for knowing about conditions (including the presence of a dangerous dog) on their property. Power to remove the dog. It wouldn\\'t be fair to hold a landlord responsible for a dog he is powerless to control or have removed. For example, say a landlord buys a building that is already occupied by a tenant who has both a one-year lease and a dangerous dog. The landlord probably won\\'t be liable for any injuries the dog causes, because the landlord may not be able to order the dog removed. But if the tenant has a month-to-month rental agreement, which can be terminated on 30 days\\' notice, the landlord who does nothing after finding out the tenant has a dangerous dog may be liable if the dog later hurts someone.

Under some laws, landlords are not  liable even when they know a tenant\\'s dog is likely to hurt someone. A  Montana rancher, for example, knew that a dog belonging to his foreman  (who lived on the rancher\\'s property) had bitten someone. But when the  dog later bit a utility company meter-reader, the rancher wasn\\'t held liable. If, however, the rancher had exercised some control over the animal - was a  \"keeper\" under the law - he would have been liable. 38\\nActual knowledge. To be held liable, a landlord must actually know that  a tenant\\'s dog is a danger to others.\\n[7] A tenant does not automatically forfeit the deposit for breaking a lease, but the deposit can be used to cover costs for which the tenant is liable. If a tenant must break a lease, doing everything possible to help the landlord re-rent the premises will reduce the tenant\\'s liability. The landlord may have grounds to keep some or all of a deposit given to take a rental unit off the market, based on losses the landlord suffered. If a tenant has entered into a lease with a landlord and paid a security deposit or prepaid rent and does not move into the unit, the tenant is entitled to a full refund if the tenant finds a replacement tenant satisfactory to the landlord who moves in by the date the lease was to begin. On the other hand, if the landlord secures the replacement tenant, the landlord may deduct from the security deposit or rent prepayment any amount agreed to in the lease as a lease cancellation fee OR actual expenses incurred by the landlord, including a reasonable amount for the landlord\\'s time in finding a replacement tenant. Once the property is rented to someone else, the tenant is not liable for additional rent unless the unit is sublet. If the property stands vacant for several days, weeks, or months, the landlord will be able to deduct from the deposit the actual amount of rent the landlord lost until a new tenant starts paying. If the property remains vacant for a period that is longer than is covered by the security deposit, then the landlord can hold the tenant liable for the lost rent covering the lease term until someone does move in so long as the landlord makes reasonable efforts to lease the property. The landlord can also charge for re-renting costs such as advertising. Some leases have a reletting fee written into the contract.\\n[8] What is Landlord Liability\\nLandlord liability is a form of premises liability that holds a property owner accountable for injuries that are sustained by residents or even pedestrians on the owner’s property; for example, someone who trips and falls on a cracked sidewalk. Other types of dangers, such as faulty wiring or toxic mold are also categorized under landlord liability. Property owners have a legal responsibility to maintain the property so it is safe and suitable for human habitation. If they fail in this duty, and residents are hurt, they can be held legally responsible, or liable. About Landlord Liability\\nAn apartment or property owner (landlord or lessor) who leases an apartment can be held liable to the tenant (lessee) and the tenant’s guests for dangerous conditions existing in the apartment unit that the landlord does not inform the tenant about and the dangerous condition is not obvious. Before leasing an apartment unit to a prospective tenant, the apartment owner has a duty to ensure it is safe from dangerous conditions based on what a reasonable inspection would normally disclose. The landlord is not required to take extraordinary measures to discover every potential hazard unless the circumstances justify it. If a dangerous condition arises in the apartment unit that the tenant promptly reports to the landlord, the landlord must repair it within a reasonable period of time after learning of the dangerous condition. A landlord generally is not liable for dangerous condition in the tenant’s apartment that come into existence after the tenant takes possession:\\n[9] But not all states use this rule. Under some laws, landlords are not liable even when they know a tenant\\'s dog is likely to hurt someone. A Montana rancher, for example, knew that a dog belonging to his foreman (who lived on the rancher\\'s property) had bitten someone. But when the dog later bit a utility company meter-reader, the rancher wasn\\'t held liable. If, however, the rancher had exercised some control over the animal, he would have been liable. ( Criswell v. Brewer, 741 P.2d 418 (Mont. 1987).) Actual knowledge. To be held liable, a landlord must actually know that a tenant\\'s dog is a danger to others. In practice, that means the landlord must know that the dog has already threatened or injured someone. For example, a landlord who knows only that a tenant\\'s dog is kept chained and barks at people who approach probably will not be held liable if the dog bites someone.\\n[10] A friend of mine who deals in real estate law told me today that a landlord who is aware that his tenants are potentially injurious or in the habit of breaking the law and does nothing about the behavior may be liable for the damage his tenants cause. There\\'s no statue, but there is case law precedent, which I\\'ll be researching. My friend said that the landlord/tenant arrangement is a business arrangement, and just like the government being able to seize a rented house when tenants use it for drug manufacturing, a landlord can be held liable when he knows his tenants might cause harm and does nothing to safeguard his neighbors.

Marriage is a legally recognized union between two partners in a relationship. The average age to first get married varies from one country to another and is affected by several factors such as financial stability, career, academic pursuit, and family background. The average age for first marriage for men is slightly higher than that of women in most of the countries around the world mainly because of societal expectations and perceptions. However, the average age for the first marriage has been on the rise for the past two decades because of the postponement of family formation and increase in the cohabitation incidences as opposed to formal marriages. Average Age At First Marriage: Trends in Europe\\nMarriages are earliest in Eastern European countries where the bride’s age ranges between 22 and 26 years while the groom’s age range between 24 and 27 years. In Moldova, most men marry at the age of 26 while women are married as low as 24 years. Women in most countries in Central Europe such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and Belgium marry after the age of 27 years while most of the men marry at the age of 30 years. Northern, Southern, and Western Europe have the highest average age at first marriage for both men and women.\\n[2] This little known plugin reveals the answer. In other cultures, age at marriage may be slightly lower. For example, in Mexico the mean age of marriage currently is 23.3 years for men and 18.4 years for women. This has increased as well, reflecting Mexico’s increasing industrialization. The average age for men at marriage has risen by two years since 1980, with women seeing an increase of three years. Currently the average age at marriage in the US is 26.8 years for men, and 25.1 years for women. It is interesting that though this represents an increased age for men, it is not significantly higher than the rate 100 years ago. Actually age rates at marriage for men declined from 1910 through 1960. Lowest average age for marriage in men was in 1960, when the mean age for marriage was 22.8 years. Jane Austen, writing in the early 19th century, had heroines married at the earliest age of 17 or 18.\\n[3] Currently the average age at marriage in the US is 26.8 years for men, and 25.1 years for women.

Jane Austen, writing in the early 19th century, had heroines married at the earliest age of 17 or 18. There are negligible declines in average age at marriage from 1910-1960 in women. However the difference between the 1910 figures and figures in 1960 are less than two years. In men, the difference is a more significant four year spread. However by the 1970s both figures increased. The largest jump in a decade was women’s average age at marriage in 1980 and 1990.\\n[4] Average Age At First Marriage: Trends in Europe\\nMarriages are earliest in Eastern European countries where the bride’s age ranges between 22 and 26 years while the groom’s age range between 24 and 27 years.

Women in most countries in Central Europe such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and Belgium marry after the age of 27 years while most of the men marry at the age of 30 years. Northern, Southern, and Western Europe have the highest average age at first marriage for both men and women. Women in these countries marry at the age of about 30 years while men marry a bit later. Sweden has the highest average age at first marriage (34.6) with women marrying at 33.3 years and men at 35 years followed by Nordic countries (Iceland, Denmark, and Norway) and Spain. In most of the Nordic countries, about 30% of the women and fewer than 20% of the women aged between 25 and 29 are married. Factors Influencing Age At First Marriage\\nFrom the data, most of the wealthiest countries in Europe appear to have a higher average age at first marriage than their less developed counterparts. Most men and women postpone marriage in countries where they enjoy the higher social status, better education system, and employment.\\n[5] Average age for cats to die?

An earlier analysis showed the vast majority of Americans have been married or plan to get married some day, most believe it is very important for committed couples to get married, but many feel it is less important for unwed couples to marry specifically because of having a child. New data being released from that poll finds that the average American believes that 25 is the ideal age for a woman to get married, while the ideal age for men is 27. Americans\\' views of the best age for marriage have shifted greatly in the past 60 years, more so for women than for men. Best Age for Marriage\\nThe May 8-11, 2006, poll asked Americans for their opinion on the ideal ages for men and women to get married.

(\\n[7] CREST Syndrome\\nSystemic sclerosis often involves a group of symptoms known as CREST syndrome. Features of CREST syndrome: Calcinosis: Formation of calcium deposits in the connective tissue\\nRaynaud\\'s phenomenon: The blood vessels of the hands or feet contract in response to triggers, like cold or anxiety\\nEsophageal dysfunction: Impaired function of esophageal smooth muscles\\nSclerodactyly: Thick and tight skin on your fingers due to deposits of excess collagen within skin layers\\nTelangiectasias: Small red spots on the hands and face caused by swelling of tiny blood vessels\\nA late complication of CREST can be elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Monitoring for this condition is recommended, typically by pulmonary function testing and/or echocardiogram. Limited Scleroderma\\nSystemic sclerosis is divided into two categories, limited and diffuse.\\n[8] hypothyroidism; sicca syndrome; and arthralgias and tenosynovitis. Dysphagia is often present because of esophageal disease and is usually not an indication of bulbar neurological dysfunction. The syndrome of subcutaneous calcinosis, Raynaud\\'s phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia (CREST) may be present with less systemic involvement. More than half the patients with progressive systemic sclerosis have evidence of autoimmunity such as antinuclear antibodies or, less common but more specific, antibodies against centromeres, topoisomerase I, RNA polymerase III, or Scl-70. These provide some prognostic clues: anti–SCL-70 antibody is more often associated with fully developed progressive systemic sclerosis, whereas anticentromere antibodies are associated with CREST. Neurological complications are relatively limited in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. These include headache, myopathy, trigeminal neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, ectopic calcifications, and stroke.\\n[9] In progressive systemic sclerosis, the skin is affected in a number of other ways, including calcifications, telangiectasias, finger swelling, and sclerodactyly (tightening of the skin of the digits). Raynaud\\'s phenomenon occurs in as many as 90% of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis. Other systemic manifestations are gastrointestinal disease, especially impaired esophageal motility; pulmonary disease, such as fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension; renal or cardiac involvement, especially with hypertension; hypothyroidism; sicca syndrome; and arthralgias and tenosynovitis. Dysphagia is often present because of esophageal disease and is usually not an indication of bulbar neurological dysfunction. The syndrome of subcutaneous calcinosis, Raynaud\\'s phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia (CREST) may be present with less systemic involvement.\\n[10] Raynaud’s phenomenon (the “R” in CREST syndrome): A condition of poor blood circulation that causes the toes and fingertips to turn white, and then blue and numb. When circulation returns to normal, the affected skin looks red and may tingle. Raynaud’s phenomenon is an early symptom of limited scleroderma, but it can also occur independent of scleroderma. Red skin marks (telangiectasia - the “T” in CREST syndrome): The swelling of small blood vessels near the skin surface creates small red spots or lines on the hands and face. Skin bumps (calcinosis - the “C” in CREST syndrome): Calcium deposits under the skin can cause small raised areas on the elbows, knees and fingers. These bumps can be painful or get infected.

What environmental factors does not affect the rate of photosynthesis? Everything except; Light intensity, Carbon Dioxide\\nconcentration, Temperature\\nHow does temperature affect the rate of photoysistes? The higher the temperature, the higher the rate of\\nphotosynthesis. Photosynthesis is affected by more than one factor. The other factors are light and carbon dioxide. What happens to the rate of photosynthesis if you increase the level of carbon dioxide? the more you give plant carbon dioxide it will probably be able\\nto photosynthesis faster. In bright sunlight the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air can limit the rate of photosynthesis?\\n[5] Light intensity\\nCarbon dioxide concentration\\nTemperature\\nIt is useful to be able to interpret a graph like the example below. This graph shows the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis at two different carbon dioxide concentrations. Light intensity is limiting the rate of photosynthesis at light intensities of 0 to 3.75 units. As light intensity is increased the rate of photosynthesis increases. At light intensities of 3.75 to 5.5, a carbon dioxide concentration of 0.03 per cent is insufficient and limits the rate of photosynthesis. A carbon dioxide concentration of 0.1 per cent is sufficient and the rate of photosynthesis continues to increase as light intensity increases. At light intensities of 5.5 units and above, a carbon dioxide concentration of 0.1 per cent is limiting and the rate of photosynthesis does not increase even when light intensity is increased. Light intensity is not limiting the rate of photosynthesis at light intensities of five to eight units. As light intensity is increased the rate of photosynthesis remains the same. At light intensities of five to eight units carbon dioxide concentration is limiting the rate of photosynthesis.\\n[6] Here are some of the factors affecting photosynthesis. Light Intensity: An increased light intensity leads to a high rate of photosynthesis and a low light intensity would mean low rate of photosynthesis. Concentration of CO 2: Higher carbon dioxide concentration increases the rate of photosynthesis. Normally the carbon dioxide concentration of 0.03 to 0.04 percent is sufficient for photosynthesis. Temperature: An efficient photosynthesis requires an optimum temperature range between 25 to 35 o C.\\nWater: Water is an essential factor for photosynthesis. The lack of water also leads to a problem for carbon dioxide intake.\\n[7] Temperature\\nLight intensity\\nLight wavelength\\nCarbon dioxide availability\\nChlorophyll concentration\\nWater availability\\nNamely, the higher the light intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide and chlorophyll concentration, the faster the rate at which photosynthesis occurs. But there is an optimum rate. In the case of light intensity, photosynthesis rate is higher in red or blue light and very low in green light. Photosynthesis rate decreases with a decrease in water availability. Now that you understand the process of photosynthesis let’s look at its importance. Importance of Photosynthesis\\nPlants play an integral role in the continuity of life on the planet, all thanks to photosynthesis. They achieve that through the following: 1. Atmospheric Gases\\nIn photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen as a by-product. Without the process of photosynthesis, it would be difficult to replenish all the oxygen being used in processes such as combustion and respiration.\\n[8] The walls of palisade and spongy parenchyma possess water. Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and ultimately passes through the walls in aqueous solution. Carbon Dioxide Concentration: If light intensity and temperature are favourable, the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere limits the rate of photosynthesis. The workers like Kreuslar (1887), Brown and Escombe (1902) and Pantanelli (1903) investigated that there is an increase in the rate of photosynthesis with an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide at the lower levels of carbon dioxide concentrations. A decline in rate was observed in higher concentrations. Blackman and his co-workers claimed that after an optimum concentration is reached, the rate of photosynthesis remains constant over a wide range of carbon dioxide concentrations. ADVERTISEMENTS: It has been demonstrated experimentally that at usual temperature and light intensities, artificial increase of carbon dioxide up to a concentration of 0.5 per cent may give an increased rate of photosynthesis, but only for a limited period. It appears that the high level of carbon dioxide is injurious to plants.\\n[9] Variables that affect the rate of photosynthesis is: -Light Intensity\\n-Carbon Dioxide concentration\\n-Temperature\\nWhat factors could affect the rate of photosynthesis? Water, light, Carbon Dioxide, and temperature. How does carbon dioxide concentration affect photosynthesis? Carbon dioxide is an essential reactant for photosynthesis to\\noccur. If there is a higher concentration of carbon dioxide, then\\nthe rate of photosynthesis will increase, and vise versa. If the\\nconcentration of carbon dioxide decreases, then the rate at which a\\nplant photosynthesizes will be slower. Resources: I\\'m an advanced bio student, and we conducted an experiment to\\ntest this. Hope this helps (:\\nWhat are 3 factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis?\\n[10] Second, for plants to remain alive, there generally must be a certain amount of water present at all times, which allows for photosynthesis to actually take place. In other words, if there was no water, the plant would die and photosynthesis wouldn\\'t take place anyway. Water may be a limiting factor in some very specific climates and plant types, however. Lesson Summary\\nLet\\'s take a couple moments to review how photosynthesis is impacted by environmental factors. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants create energy in the form of glucose from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. The chemical reaction also produces oxygen, which is released back into the atmosphere. Plants get carbon dioxide from the air, water through their roots, and energy from sunlight. We learned that light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature are the three main factors that impact photosynthesis. Greater light intensity leads to higher photosynthesis rates, as does increased carbon dioxide concentration. However, once light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration reach a certain level, photosynthesis rates level off and don\\'t increase much further.\\nInitial Nugget List: []\\nInitial Nugget List Length: 0\\n\\nOnly update the list of atomic nuggets (if needed, else return as is).

Further updates/corrections must be coordinated with DCF. If the baby\\'s number is inactive, continue following these steps to activate the newborn\\'s Medicaid identification number. Verify the mother was eligible for full Medicaid on the baby\\'s date of birth by using the Web Portal, MEVS, FaxBack, or AVRS. The Medicaid fiscal agent will not activate the baby\\'s coverage if the mother is not eligible or her eligibility category is MU (Presumptively Eligible Pregnant Woman) or her eligibility category is FP (Family Planning Services Only). Providers and Medicaid managed care plans should submit a newborn activation request through the Newborn Activation feature in the Florida Medicaid Secure Web Portal and Florida Health Plan Portal. Additional instructions and a quick reference guide can be found on the Florida Medicaid Web Portal. Within two working days after after a completed submission through the portal, the Medicaid fiscal agent will update the newborn\\'s name, gender, and birth date and activate the coverage. Once the newborn\\'s name is updated on file, a new Medicaid gold card is issued with the updated name. If the mother is in a Medicaid managed care plan, the baby will be retroactively enrolled in the same managed care plan as the mother for the first three months of life unless the mother voluntarily enrolls the baby in a different managed care plan.\\n[5] For\\n \\nup\\n \\nto\\n \\n90\\n \\ndays\\n \\nafter\\n \\nbirth,\\n \\nthe\\n \\nAgency\\n \\nwill\\n \\nenroll\\n \\na\\n \\nnewborn\\n \\nin\\n \\nthe\\n \\nsame\\n \\nplan\\n \\nas\\n \\nthe\\n \\nmother.

If you have any questions regarding this process, please contact Recipient and Provider Assistance. Provider Inquiry Newborn Spreadsheet\\nIf you know the mother is pregnant, Medicaid eligible, and her unborn child does not have a number, you may have the baby added by emailing a password protected Master Unborn Provider Spreadsheet [19KB MS Excel] to the statewide DCF email address identified on the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet can also be used to contact DCF to request assistance regarding missing eligibility for newborns or issues concerning incorrect demographics such as discrepancies in dates of birth. Please review the Provider Unborn Update Spreadsheet Completion Guide [35KB PDF] for further instructions on completing and submitting inquiries to DCF.

W. Bush. It works to avoid oil spills from vessels and facilities by enforcing removal of spilled oil and assigning liability for the cost of cleanup and damage; requires specific operating procedures; defines responsible parties and financial liability; implements processes for measuring damages; specifies damages for which violators are liable; and establishes a fund for damages, cleanup, and removal costs. This statute has resulted in instrumental changes in the oil production, transportation, and distribution industries.

Oil spill pollution may comprise a variety of amounts starting with one or more gallons of oil and up to millions or even hundreds of millions of gallons spilled. The term is usually associated with the oil spills in the ocean and coastal waters. Oil Spill Pollution refers to the negative polluting effects that oil spills have on the environments and living organisms, including humans, due to the environmental discharge of various organic compounds that make up crude oil and oil distillate products, the majority of which include various individual hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are made exclusively from carbon and hydrogen atoms which bind together in various ways, resulting in paraffins (or normal alkanes), isoparaffins (isoalkanes), aromatics (such as benzene or various PAHs), cycloalkanes and unsaturated alkanes (alkenes and alkynes). Other individual compounds that are present in crude oil and oil discharges include (apart from carbon and hydrogen) sulfur, nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms. The Oil Pollution Act\\nThe Oil Spill Pollution Act - The Oil Pollution Act is an environmental regulation adopted in 1990 in the U.S. to prevent oil spill pollution. In 1990, the Oil Pollution Act was passed by U.S. Congress and amended the existing Clean Water Act, aiming to require oil storage facilities to prepare \"Facility Response Plans\". Various revisions to the Act have been made in 1994 by the EPA.

Various revisions to the Act have been made in 1994 by the EPA. The revised plan obliged facility owners and operators to prepare and submit plans addressing a \"worst-case scenario\" of oil discharge. This regulation was meant to prevent and prepare emergency responses to oil spills. The Oil Spill Pollution Act: established new requirements and amended the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act in order to provide enhanced capabilities for oil spill response and natural resource damage assessment; required the Coast Guard to strengthen its regulations on oil tank vessels; included the specification that companies must have a cleanup plan in order to prevent spills that may occur and a detailed containment;\\n[4] What is Oil Pollution Act of 1990? definition and meaning - BusinessDictionary.com\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990\\nDefinition\\n+ Create New Flashcard\\nPopular Terms\\nA law enacted in 1990 by the U.S. ruling civil liability for removal costs or damages as a result of oil spills in waters of the United States caused by tank vessels or facilities used to explore, drill, produce, store, process, or transport oil. This definition includes motor vehicles, rolling stocks, and pipelines. The law also established provisions related to oil spill prevention, emergency response and cleanup efforts in the event of spills. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 limits the liability of companies for the economic damages caused by oil spills at 75 million dollars.\\n[5] Oil Pollution Act of 1990\\nUnited States Coast Guard U.S. Department of Homeland Security\\nNational Pollution Funds Center\\nContact NPFC\\nOil Pollution Act (OPA)\\nOil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF)\\nCOFRs\\nSpill Response Funding\\nOil Spill Claims\\nOnline Services\\nForms\\nPublications\\nRegulations\\nJobs at NPFC\\nVisitors\\nRelated Links\\nContact Webmaster\\nAbout NPFC\\n|\\nContact NPFC\\n|\\nFAQs\\n|\\nGlossary\\n|\\nSite Map\\n|\\nAnnouncements\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)\\nOn March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled over 11 million gallons of Alaskan crude into the water of Prince William Sound. There were many lessons learned the aftermath of the Valdez oil spill. Two of the most obvious were: The United States lacked adequate resources, particularly Federal funds, to respond to spills, and\\nThe scope of damages compensable under federal law to those impacted by a spill was fairly narrow. Although the environmental damage and massive cleanup efforts were the most visible effects of this casualty, one of the most important outcomes was the enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), which addressed both these deficiencies. OPA Overview\\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ( 33 U.S.C. 2701-2761) amended the Clean Water Act and addressed the wide range of problems associated with preventing, responding to, and paying for oil pollution incidents in navigable waters of the United States. It created a comprehensive prevention, response, liability, and compensation regime to deal with vessel- and facility-caused oil pollution to U.S. navigable waters. OPA greatly increased federal oversight of maritime oil transportation, while providing greater environmental safeguards by: Setting new requirements for vessel construction and crew licensing and manning,\\nMandating contingency planning,\\nEnhancing federal response capability,\\nBroadening enforcement authority,\\nIncreasing penalties,\\nCreating new research and development programs,\\nIncreasing potential liabilities, and\\nSignificantly broadening financial responsibility requirements. Title I of OPA\\nTitle I of OPA established new and higher liability limits for oil spills, with commensurate changes to financial responsibility requirements.\\n[6] Water and Air Pollution\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990\\nIn the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law that year. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 increased penalties for companies responsible for oil spills and required that all oil tankers in United States waters have a double hull. Exxon Valdez was a single-hulled tanker; a double-hull design, by making it less likely that a collision would have spilled oil, might have prevented the Exxon Valdez disaster. Fate of Exxon Valdez\\nThe ship, Exxon Valdez —first commissioned in 1986—was repaired and returned to service a year after the spill in a different ocean and under a different name. The single-hulled ship could no longer transport oil in U.S. waters, due to the new regulations. The ship began running oil transport routes in Europe, where single-hulled oil tankers were still allowed. There it was renamed the Exxon Mediterranean, then the SeaRiver Mediterranean and finally the S/R Mediterranean. In 2002, the European Union banned single-hulled tankers and the former Exxon Valdez moved to Asian waters. Exxon sold the infamous tanker in 2008 to a Hong Kong-based shipping company.\\n[7] Oil Pollution Act of 1990 - WikiMili, The Best Wikipedia Reader\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990\\nLast updated November 17, 2020 • 14 min read\\nFrom Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990\\n\\nLong title\\nOil Pollution Act of 1990 - Public Law 101-380, August 18, 1990\\nEnacted by\\nthe 101st United States Congress\\nEffective\\nAugust 18, 1990\\nCitations\\nPublic law\\n101-380\\nStatutes at Large\\n104 Stat. 484\\nCodification\\nTitles amended\\n33 U.S.C.: Navigable Waters\\nU.S.C. sections created\\n33 U.S.C. ch. 40 § 2701\\nLegislative history\\nIntroduced in the Houseas H.R. 1465 by Walter B.

It has posed health risks to the Canadian population and is an area of concern for Canadian lawmakers. Air, water and soil pollution as well as the health effects associated with these three types of pollution, are prominent points of contention in modern Canadian society.

A recent report found that Canadian companies contributed 73% more to air pollution than companies in the United States. Within the 73% more emissions it was found that Canadian companies contributed 29% more respiratory toxins into the air than the U.S.\" . This can be evidenced with Environment Canada\\'s 2010 document named Air Pollutant Emission Summaries and Historical Emission Trends. This report found that 2010 emissions, when compared to 2009 emissions, saw an overall decrease. Additionally, it was found that heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants ( smog precursors) were at lower levels in 2010 than in 1990.\\n[10] A 2001 study found oil contamination remaining at more than half of the 91 beach sites tested in Prince William Sound. The spill had killed an estimated 40 percent of all sea otters living in the Sound. The sea otter population didn’t recover to its pre-spill levels until 2014, twenty-five years after the spill. Stocks of herring, once a lucrative source of income for Prince William Sound fisherman, have never fully rebounded.

If you’re accused of laundering $1,500 to $20,000, you could get 180 days to 2 years in jail, with fines up to $10,000. If you allegedly laundered $20,000 to $100,000, this is a third-degree felony that comes with anywhere from 2 to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. If you have been accused of laundering $100,000 to $200,000, this is a second-degree felony with 2 to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. If you are accused of laundering over $100,000, it’s a first-degree felony according to Texas penal code. Money laundering of this kind\\noften comes with a $10,000 fine and 5 to 99 years in prison.

Fine: No more than $1,000. Combination: Jail time and a fine. For defendants facing felony money laundering charges, however, the consequences are more intense: Jail Time: A minimum sentence of 16 months and up to four years in jail.\\n[3] Yes. Though the typical money laundering Texas penalty depends on how much money you’re accused of laundering, this crime is always a felony. According to the Texas penal code, money laundering also falls into the category of white-collar crime, which is a type of crime that involves deceit and is driven by the desire for financial gain. How Much Jail Time for Money Laundering in Texas? So, how many years do you get for money laundering in the State of Texas? When it comes to money laundering jail time, Texas penal code requirements state that your punishment depends on how much money is involved. If you’re accused of laundering $1,500 to $20,000, you could get 180 days to 2 years in jail, with fines up to $10,000. If you allegedly laundered $20,000 to $100,000, this is a third-degree felony that comes with anywhere from 2 to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. If you have been accused of laundering $100,000 to $200,000, this is a second-degree felony with 2 to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. If you are accused of laundering over $100,000, it’s a first-degree felony according to Texas penal code.\\n[4] In that regard, money laundering is a criminal offense, as the act of hiding illegally obtained cash is a crime all its own. In the U.S., states have different interpretations of what money laundering is (and money laundering is criminalized under both state and federal statutes.) But in general, any action to hide money illegally obtained by laundering is a criminal offense. To help law enforcement officials get a better handle on prosecuting money laundering cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that, to make a case against money laundering, prosecutors must demonstrate that an individual hid money specifically to suppress the location, ownership, origin, nature, and control of the cash that was laundered. The Court ruled that money laundering wasn\\'t an offense because of the simple act of \"hiding\" money - it became a criminal offense when the cash was taken and moved through channels to give it the air of legitimacy. Penalty-wise, money laundering is virtually always cited as a felony offense, although misdemeanor cases do appear from time to time. If found guilty of a misdemeanor money laundering case, a criminal can expect a year or so in jail. If found guilty of a felony, the guilty party can expect in excess of one year in jail, plus fines and penalties. Repeat offenders have been sent away to jail for as many as 35 years. Fines vary from state to state, and with federal cases.\\n[5] From looking at these few bullet points, it should be clear that a misdemeanor money laundering charge has no set minimum penalty. Instead, the court is limited to a maximum jail sentence of one year and a maximum fine of $1,000. However, a felony money laundering conviction features a minimum jail sentence of 16 months and a minimum fine of $250,000. For a free legal consultation, call (310) 928-9347\\nPenalties Federal Money Laundering Convictions\\nFederal money laundering charges are even more serious than felony charges under the California state penal code. This is because the federal government rarely gets involved in these kinds of cases unless there is evidence of organized crime, drug trafficking, federal tax evasion, and similar issues. If you have been charged with money laundering in a federal court, contacting an experienced money laundering attorney is the most important step toward securing the best possible outcome. The penalties for a federal money laundering conviction include the following: Jail Time: A maximum sentence of 20 years in a federal prison\\nFines: $500,000 or twice the amount of money that was laundered.\\n[6] Money Laundering: Penalties & Prison Time\\nMoney Laundering Prison Time (Updated for 2019)\\n10 Nov, 2019\\nUncategorized\\nMoney Laundering Overview\\nThe concern about possible penalties for money laundering has recently increased. Money Laundering is broken down into three degrees which yield different class felonies. First-Degree Money Laundering\\nFirst-degree money laundering is a class two (2) felony . This means that for a first offense, punishment can be probation with zero (0) days in jail up to one (1) year in jail, or prison of three (3) years to twelve and one half (12.5) years of incarceration. Now, if the person has a prior felony conviction, then the sentences increase drastically. For example, one (1) prior conviction puts you in to “prison only” range which is four and a half (4.5) years to twenty-three and one quarter (23.25) years in prison. If the person has two (2) prior convictions then it increases to “prison only” with ten and one half (10.5) years to thirty-five (35) years of incarceration. Second-Degree Money Laundering\\nSecond-degree money laundering is a class three (3) felony. First offense:\\n[7] Penalty-wise, money laundering is virtually always cited as a felony offense, although misdemeanor cases do appear from time to time. If found guilty of a misdemeanor money laundering case, a criminal can expect a year or so in jail. If found guilty of a felony, the guilty party can expect in excess of one year in jail, plus fines and penalties. Repeat offenders have been sent away to jail for as many as 35 years. Fines vary from state to state, and with federal cases. As a rule of thumb, though, fines are often designated in twice the amount of the money laundered. For example, if a criminal launders $500,000 in cash, the fine often stands at $1 million. History of Money Laundering\\nHistorically, money laundering has been around in some form for 2,000 years, when Chinese merchants cycled money through various businesses and complex financial transactions to hide the income from government bureaucrats, who sought to garnish the income. Some historians tie the term \"money laundering\" more prominently to the early 1900\\'s and gangsters like Al Capone, who is said to have to bought up laundromats to funnel dirty money (from activities like bootlegging and prostitution) through the laundromats and mix the cash with legitimate business income. In that way, Capone and other gangsters were able to hide the money from law authorities\\nIt wasn\\'t until later in the 20th century when law enforcement tied the terms \"money\" and \"laundering\" together - partly to identify gang members, drug dealers, Mafia kingpins and other criminal elements who disguised the source of cash earned illegally, and laundered that cash into legitimate and legal funds.\\n[8] Instead, the business owner creates the illusion that the money made from selling drugs was made through the services of the shell company. If you have been accused of drug trafficking or money laundering, you will need the services of experienced Houston federal drug trafficking lawyer Seth Kretzer. You could be facing time in jail and steep fines if convicted. Is Money Laundering a Felony? Is money laundering a felony? Yes. Though the typical money laundering Texas penalty depends on how much money you’re accused of laundering, this crime is always a felony. According to the Texas penal code, money laundering also falls into the category of white-collar crime, which is a type of crime that involves deceit and is driven by the desire for financial gain. How Much Jail Time for Money Laundering in Texas? So, how many years do you get for money laundering in the State of Texas?\\n[9] Money Laundering – First Degree\\nMoney Laundering in the First-Degree occurs if a person knowingly initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages, supervises or is in the business of conducting any of the above activities. Basically, Money Laundering in the First-Degree is being the leader, boss, or creator of any of the Money Laundering in the Second-Degree activities. Money Laundering in the First-Degree can also be charged when any of Second-Degree Money Laundering activities are done in the course of, or for the purpose of, facilitating terrorism or murder. Money Laundering – Third Degree\\nA person can be charged with Money Laundering in the Third-Degree if in the course of any transaction transmitting money, he intentionally or knowingly confers or agrees to confer anything of value on a money transmitter or any employee of a money transmitter that is intended to influence or reward any person for failing to comply with any requirement under title 6, chapter 12 (financial banking and disclosure requirements). The employee of a money transmitting business can also be charged with Money Laundering in the Third-Degree if they allow themselves to receive something of value in exchange for failing to comply with any requirement of Title 6, Chapter 12.

Possible Penalties for Money Laundering\\n“First-Degree” is a class two (2) felony. For a first offense, punishment can be probation with zero (0) days in jail up to one (1) year in jail, or prison of three (3) years to twelve and one half (12.5) years of incarceration. If the person has one (1) allegeable historical prior conviction, then the “prison only” range is four and one half (4.5) years to twenty-three and one quarter (23.25) years in prison. If the person has two (2) allegeable historical prior convictions, then the “prison only” range is ten and one half (10.5) years to thirty-five (35) years of incarceration.\\n[10] The minimum penalty for a conviction in these situations depends on the specifics of the case in question, but the first step to take when charged with money laundering is to contact a qualified Los Angeles money laundering attorney who can represent your interests and make sure that your rights are protected. Prosecutors in California can choose to pursue charges in money laundering cases as either a misdemeanor or a felony. This usually depends on the type of activity associated with the “dirty money,” the amount of money involved in the alleged crime, and the extent of the money laundering network. In larger and more serious cases connected to organized crime, a defendant in a money laundering case may also face RICO or racketeering charges.

A jammed finger is most commonly caused by an injury to the joint in the middle of the finger, where it bends in half. This joint is called the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). Small ligaments called the collateral ligaments support the PIP joint. A jammed finger may occur when then these ligaments are overstretched or strained. This damage can happen when the hands absorb too much force, such as when someone catches a ball when playing sports. A jammed finger can be uncomfortable, but it is not usually a serious injury.

His theory suggests that traditional notions of intelligence as one general ability are far too narrow. Instead, Gardner proposed a list of eight different types of intelligences to account for a much broader range of human potential which occurs in children and adults. Email me more like this…\\nDr. Howard Gardner is an American developmental psychologist who first outlined his theory of multiple intelligences in his book ‘Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences’ published in 1983. Gardner believed human intelligence was not just one general ability but a suite of eight different abilities which occur in children and adults. These abilities are: Linguistic-Verbal intelligence (good with words and language)\\nLogical-Mathematical intelligence (good with numbers and reasoning)\\nVisual-Spatial intelligence (good at visualising things)\\nBodily-Kinesthetic intelligence (good at body actions and physical control)\\nMusical-Rhythmic intelligence (good musical skills)\\nInterpersonal intelligence (good at understanding and relating to people)\\nIntrapersonal intelligence (aware of personal emotions, feelings and motivation)\\nNaturalistic intelligence (well in tune with nature and the natural environment)\\nHoward Gardner Multiple Intelligence Theory\\nGardner believed his multiple intelligence theory is a more accurate way of describing ability than narrow IQ theories which suggested intelligence is:\\n[5] Howard Gardner appears to have embraced the opportunities there – and to have elicited the support and interest of some very able teachers. From there he went to Harvard University to study history in readiness for a career in the law. However, he was lucky enough to have Eric Erikson as a tutor. In Howard Gardner’s words Erikson probably ‘sealed’ his ambition to be a scholar (1989: 23). But there were others: My mind was really opened when I went to Harvard College and had the opportunity to study under individuals—such as psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, sociologist David Riesman, and cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner—who were creating knowledge about human beings. That helped set me on the course of investigating human nature, particularly how human beings think. ( Howard Gardner quoted by Marge Sherer 1999)\\nHoward Gardner’s interest in psychology and the social sciences grew (his senior thesis was on a new California retirement community) and he graduated summa cum laude in 1965. Howard Gardner then went to work for a brief period with Jerome Bruner on the famous MACOS Project (‘Man:\\n[6] Multiple Intelligences Test\\nBased on the work of Howard Gardner, Ph.D.\\nDevelopmental psychologist at Harvard University Howard Gardner developed the theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to Gardner, people have different kinds of intelligences, and the Multiple Intelligences framework is fairer than IQ tests, which only measure one type of aptitude. The theory of Multiple Intelligences enjoys considerable popularity among educators, with many teachers using it in the classroom to help young people discover their path in life.

I want them to understand it so that they will be positioned to make it a better place. Knowledge is not the same as morality, but we need to understand if we are to avoid past mistakes and move in productive directions. An important part of that understanding is knowing who we are and what we can do… Ultimately, we must synthesize our understandings for ourselves. The performance of understanding that try matters are the ones we carry out as human beings in an imperfect world which we can affect for good or for ill. ( Howard Gardner 1999: 180-181)\\nHoward Earl Gardner’s (1943- ) work has been marked by a desire not to just describe the world but to help to create the conditions to change it.\\n[9] Multiple Intelligences (Howard Gardner) - InstructionalDesign.org\\nHome » Learning Theories » Multiple Intelligences (Howard Gardner)\\nMultiple Intelligences (Howard Gardner)\\nThe theory of multiple intelligences suggests that there are a number of distinct forms of intelligence that each individual possesses in varying degrees. Gardner proposes seven primary forms: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, intrapersonal (e.g., insight, metacognition) and interpersonal (e.g., social skills). According to Gardner , the implication of the theory is that learning/teaching should focus on the particular intelligences of each person. For example, if an individual has strong spatial or musical intelligences, they should be encouraged to develop these abilities. Gardner points out that the different intelligences represent not only different content domains but also learning modalities. A further implication of the theory is that assessment of abilities should measure all forms of intelligence, not just linguistic and logical-mathematical. Gardner also emphasizes the cultural context of multiple intelligences. Each culture tends to emphasize particular intelligences. For example, Gardner (1983) discusses the high spatial abilities of the Puluwat people of the Caroline Islands, who use these skills to navigate their canoes in the ocean.\\n[10] nine\\nThose who define intelligence as academic aptitude are most likely to criticize\\nGardner\\'s concept of multiple intelligences.
