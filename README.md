**OpenNuggetizer: An Open-Source Framework for Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems**

OpenNuggetizer is an open-source tool designed to assess the factual accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by generating, scoring, and assigning information nuggets to RAG outputs. Inspired by the original [Nuggetizer framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09607), OpenNuggetizer exclusively utilizes open-source inference models, ensuring accessibility and adaptability for the research community.

**Key Features:**

- **Information Nugget Generation:** Automatically extract concise information units ("nuggets") from textual data to facilitate detailed evaluation.

- **Nugget Scoring and Assignment:** Assess and align these nuggets with RAG-generated responses to measure factual consistency and relevance.

- **Open-Source Integration:** Leverage open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

2. **Configuration:** Set up your environment to integrate with preferred open-source inference models.

3. **Usage:** Utilize the provided APIs to input RAG outputs and receive detailed nugget-based evaluations.
